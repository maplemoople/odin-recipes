# Recipe Project

**First Project** : Creating A simple webpage with links to different recipes :)
 - Using HTML initially
 - Editing it later to make it look nicer (CSS)

**Reflection** : I should have completed this WAY earlier LOL

Good introduction to the workflow of creating stuff in HTML then editing it with CSS. I plan on making a better website for family recipes (its going to look so cool)
