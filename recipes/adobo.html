    <h2>Pork Adobo with rice and green onions</h2>
    <p>A salty sour savory pork dish straight from my mom. My personal favorite Filipino dish that is super easy to make.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork Shoulder</li>
        <li>White Vinegar</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut Pork into roughly 1 inch cubes and place into pot</li>
        <li>Fill pot a bit more than half of the height of the pork with water</li>
        <li>Fill the rest of the height of the pork with vinegar</li>
        <li>Add 2 Bay Leaves and a lot of Grinded Black Pepper <em>(and whole peppercorns if you want)</em></li>
        <li>Heat up to a boil and simmer for roughly 40 minutes</li>
        <li>Add a bit of soy sauce <em>(add a little less than you would think, you can always add more after)</em></li>
        <li>Let it simmer for another 20 or until the pork is super soft</li>
        <p><strong>Optional</strong></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px">7.5. Take the pork out and fry them with oil on a seperate pan till the sides are nice and seared</p>
        <li>Now serve with some white rice and add a bit of green onions and other toppings to enjoy :)</li>
    </ol>
